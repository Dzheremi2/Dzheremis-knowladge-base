## What is QTK
QTK declares as Quantum Tool Kit
QTK is used as Kit of high and low systemwide funcs and widgets for building apps interfaces and functionality, provides a lot of components from QTK.system.console to QTK.interface.UI.connectable.button
QTK used as basic system lib and [QOS](QOS⚛️.md) won't work without QTK, [QFS](QFS.md) won't work without QTK
QTK is a monopoly of app's libs. All of apps are written in QTK. QTK updates directly with system. It's even a system impossible dependency which means you cannot remove QTK at all. QTK can be removed only by system full uninstalling.

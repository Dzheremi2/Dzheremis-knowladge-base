Qubit in processor can be imagined as  cube with 4 Input and 4 output subqubits. All subqubits can calculate data --> so qubit has 4input, 4output, 8calculation subqubits.

Data in qubits written by inflector and exported by deflector

Each qubit can store [$512^{512}$ file of any size](ESFS.Q.md), but only theoretically, not practically. 

Qubits in [QOS](QOS⚛️.md) are controlled by Kernel(Not core), using [QBitHandler](System%20bootloading%20process.md)
